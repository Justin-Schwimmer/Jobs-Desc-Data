About the Role

We're seeking a talented Senior Backend Engineer who is passionate about crafting high-performance, scalable systems in Golang. This is an opportunity to join a growing startup, where you'll be responsible for designing and implementing core backend infrastructure, focusing on performance, reliability, and scalability for our AI-enabled legal-tech platform.

What You'll Do:

Develop and Optimize Backend Systems: Write efficient, clean, and maintainable code primarily in Golang. You'll build the core backend infrastructure, ensuring high performance and scalability.
Architect and Scale Infrastructure: Design and diagram complex, multi-tiered architectures, including video processing and streaming clusters. Your designs will be capable of scaling from 10 to 1000+ servers, with an understanding of step functions and performance considerations at each tier.
Enhance Performance at Scale: Utilize high-performance computing techniques and best practices in scalable computing. You'll pack bits, manage concurrency with CSP (Communicating Sequential Processes), and optimize data structures for speed and efficiency.
Collaborate Across Teams: Work with cross-functional teams to integrate frontend and backend systems, although in-depth frontend expertise is not required. Your role focuses on backend excellence, with a strong foundation in architecture.
Innovate with Technology: Continuously learn and experiment with new technologies like Rust and C/C++, bringing new insights to our tech stack.
Who You Are:

Experienced Backend Engineer: You have extensive experience with Golang and are skilled in high-performance and scalable computing. You're comfortable with concepts like CSP and can easily explain why Golang maps are unordered.
System Architect: You think in terms of architectures, able to design robust, scalable systems and explain them at a high level. You're familiar with the complexities of scaling clusters to 1000+ machines and understand the shift in paradigms at various scale tiers.
Tech Enthusiast: You bring an engineering mindset that sees software development as both an art and a science. Whether discussing bit-packing optimizations or the trade-offs in hash map implementations, you have a passion for well-crafted systems.
Independent Problem-Solver: You have a natural drive to dive into challenges, from backend-specific optimization to scalable architecture. You can break down complex problems and provide elegant solutions without heavy external guidance.
Preferred Skills:

Proficiency in Golang (experience with Rust or C/C++ is a plus).
Solid knowledge of high-performance computing, scalable computing, and CSP principles.
Familiarity with designing, deploying, and managing large-scale clusters, particularly for video processing and streaming.
Strong understanding of data structures, algorithm optimizations, and memory management."
